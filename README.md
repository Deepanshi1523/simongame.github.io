# Simon Game
The Simon game is a classic memory and pattern recognition game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game interface typically includes four colored buttons: green, red, yellow, and blue. The objective of the game is for the player to repeat a progressively longer sequence of button presses generated by the computer.

The game starts with pressing any button button. When clicked, the computer randomly illuminates one of the colored buttons, signaling the first step in the sequence. The player must then click on the illuminated button. After the player successfully reproduces the sequence, the computer adds another step to the pattern, and the player must repeat the longer sequence. This pattern continues, with the sequence getting longer each time the player successfully completes a round.

Each button press is accompanied by a visual and/or auditory cue to aid the player in remembering the sequence. The game keeps track of the player's progress in terms of the number of successfully completed rounds.

If the player makes a mistake and clicks the wrong button or fails to reproduce the sequence correctly, the game ends. The player's final score, indicating the number of rounds completed, is typically displayed.

The use of HTML provides the structure for the game elements, CSS is employed for styling and layout, and JavaScript handles the game's logic and interactivity. The combination of these technologies results in a visually engaging and interactive experience that challenges the player's memory and concentration.
